  # 👾 Interbyte 
  
*A news website built using Vite and React.*

 </div>

  ## How is it built?

  The goal of this project was to create and deploy an API that allows application data to be accessed programmatically. It provides server-side rendering for my next project: the front-end of Interbyte News. 

  📝 **Written using React**
  🚀 **Utilises Vite**
  📈 **Uses media queries for responsive design**
  🔒 **Makes use of axios for simple, clean syntax when making API calls**
  ⚙️ **Employs branching and Pull Requests**
  💡 **Planned wireframing and component tree using Figma**
